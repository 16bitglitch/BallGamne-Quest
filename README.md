Hi Friends!

So I realized this didn't have a readme, which is super poor form.

To run the project, simply download, and open it as a new project in Unity!

The code is definitely sloppy because I don't quite understand how 
Unity code should be structured, so if you have a specific question, 
please shoot me an email: isaaclandoncohen@gmail.com

The shaders are pretty fun / usuable code, the Room.cs shows a nice 
demo of compute shaders, and I like a few of the pieces of VR code.

Other than that, you might be wading through some trash, so please
let me help you make it through the swamps of dagoba
